# Pokemon-Cards
Info about pokemon cards.
In this project I used Node.js, Express, also Axios for client-server communication and public API.
This is the open source multilingual Pok√©mon TCG API which I used to get data. 
In my website you can read one random pokemon card each time.
You need npm i and nodemon index.js to run the code, will be on port 3000. 
I had fun, hope you too.
